# Instructions

This lab is performed entirely at the command line!  However, you have the option of reading the instructions in either an HTML page or within a Jupyter notebook.

If you would like to view the HTML version, open "Git_Workshop_v4.html" in your browser.

If you would like to use the Jupyter notebook version, startup a Jupyter server within this directory using the command `jupyter notebook`.  If you are on Windows, you will likely need to do this within the "Anaconda Prompt" application.
